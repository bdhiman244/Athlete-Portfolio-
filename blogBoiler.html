        <p class="article-main has-dropcap">I pulled through Gourette a couple minutes off the lead, feeling rather low. The shock of two hard falls on the
        decent had me reeling. I filled my bottles, one salty, one sweet and leaned into the next climb trying to shake the
        negative vibes with the mantra, “Race to the line.” I ticked Col du Tortes promptly, but the downhill legs
        had abandoned me and the race was not going to plan.<br><br><span class="article-list__title">The Race Plan<br></span>

                <li class="article-list__item">Run fast where the terrain permits</li>
                <li class="article-list__item">Run (pit-pat<sup>*</sup>) as much of the uphill as you can, power hiking where necessary</li>

            </ul>
            <span class="definition container">*pit-pat technique: short on-the-toes stride used when grade is very steep (>25%)</span>
            <div class="img-wrap"><img class="img-photo" src="/images/blog-photos/SkyraceGabizos-closeup.JPG" alt="close-up of runner"></div>
            <span class="article-list__title">How It Went<br><br></span>
            <ul class="article-list container">
                <li class="article-list__item">Successfully ran rolling terrain quickly (though precious little of it)</li>
                <li class="article-list__item">Generally pit-patted well, lost power on the upper ¼ of the big climb, but was otherwise consistent</li>
                <li class="article-list__item">Absolutely missed the mark on the descents and lost between 4-6 minutes</li>
            </ul>
            <br>I bounced down Col du Tortes timidly. There was just one climb left and if I had any gas was free to rev the engine. I fumed up in second gear mostly on my toes despite the 30% grade to the last aid station. I
            drank some water and filled a bottle with half-coke-half-water, a trusted cocktail when feeling poorly. <br><br>Again I met the
            top of the pass with a dismal distrust of my downhill legs. Close to town the terrain was running smoother and I opened it up as best I could. I pounded down the streets clipping 3'10''/km and thought maybe I could catch
            fourth who appeared completely out of the blue hobbling to the finish. It was 6 seconds too late and I finished 5th in 3h24m, bruised and dissatisfied.<br><br>
        There would be three days of humility after the race. Quads sore to the touch, a knee induced gimp down the stairs. When
        real sore I continue training, this time I did not. Not out of unwillingness but to allow a period for the body and mind
        to be made whole before the next critical training block lasting the month of August.<br><br>
        
        Racing gives the mind and body the excuse to cut lose and take damage. Its up to us to decide how much damage and what
        to do with it. <br><br>Soreness = Humility = Deliverance <br><br>I welcome defeat as I
        welcome victory. The sense of annihilation is what got me into the sport and its good to return. With two ultras remaining in the season, I am prepared to refocus my training to go longer and accumulate resilience
        in the process.<br><br>
