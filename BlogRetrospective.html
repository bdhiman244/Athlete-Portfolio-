        Barring some episode of self-transcendence, <span class="italics">results are a function of preparation.</span> After a string of
        underwhelming results in 2021, I gave myself an ultimatum: perform or knock it off. Its a team effort now that I have a family. We sacrfrifice a great deal to my ambition, so its only natural I demmand the best of myself.<br>

            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Crafting a Race Calendar</div>
        The main goal was always the Grand Raid and I tried to design a race calendar which would deliver me prepared, basically
        to increase specificity towards this objective as the season went on. I front loaded my season with a series of short
        races 22-25km to make me faster and expanded out to 74km then 100km before the Diagonale des Fous (165km).

            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Training Phase 1: Periodization</div>
            Running all winter, I was concerned about my proclivity to ramp volume too quickly. To buffer this I
            settled on a periodization approach, wherein each month I gradually increase volume for three weeks and on the fourth week cut volume in half. The general theme for winter training was to build a solid cardiovascular base and develop some strength and speed. The program was inspired by the book, &nbsp;<a href="https://uphillathlete.com/product/training-for-the-uphill-athlete-book/" target="_blank" class="quiet-link"><span class="italics">Training for the Uphill Athlete</span></a> by Steve House, Scott Johnston, and Kilian Jornet.

            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Winter</div>
        Winter conditions make it hard to get in the mountains everyday. I did not have a ski setup so was forced to option two: the treadmill. I did 2-3 days a week in the local gym, hitting four types of treadmill workouts:<br>
        <ul class="article-list">
            <li class="article-list__item"><span class="article-list__title">VertOut (hiking power)</span>&nbsp;: 2h @ 16% grade with a weight vest (18kg) 6-7.5 km/hr</li>
            <li class="article-list__item"><span class="article-list__title">Intervals</span>&nbsp;: 45min-1 hour mixed bag of intervals all going uphill<br>
            <span class="article-list__item">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example</span>: 10 x 4min @ 16% increasing speed from 8-10 km/hr<br>
        <span class="article-list__item">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example</span>: (2 x 6min 2 x 12min) x 2 @ 12% speed 9-12km/hr</li>
            <li class="article-list__item"><span class="article-list__title">Tempo</span>&nbsp;: 1-2hr fluctuating grade and speed to resemble a 'hilly course'
            </li>
            <li class="article-list__item"><span class="article-list__title">Recovery</span>&nbsp;: 1hr @ 10-12 km/hr 2% grade (more ergonomic)</li>
        </ul>
        I reserved the stationary bike for recovery weeks and did minimal weight work, mostly general strength stuff like lunges, squats, and kettle bell exercises. I did one long run a month between 30-40km, usually outside with climbing. If possible I would substitute treadmill hiking for a heavy carry up the mountain, toting 15L of water up 1000m and dumping it for the descent.<br><br>
        <img src="./images/blog-photos/actionshotSpring2.jpg" alt="running uphill">
            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Spring</div>
            Spring spells consistency, over four months I took 8 days off including 5 consecutive with a bad case of covid. Come march I arrived at 'cruising altitude', 160km/week. I did not want to continue ramping volume so changed tactics. Once the snow melted out I dropped the gym pass and ran exclusivly in the hills.<br>

            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Phase 2: Long-Blocks/Racing</div>
            I wanted to retain good volume but still allow plenty of easy days. My solution was to do 10 day blocks and shoot for an
            average of 17-22km/day. Racing kicked off in May and there would be variation in volume depending on proximity to each race.<br><br>
     I made the mistake of doing too many short races. Although I did well, breaking two course records and enjoying the intensity of all-out efforts, these short races were not wise choices. They broke up training and offered little in the way of specific adaptations for my primary objectives.<br>
            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Phase 3: Race-Specfic Block</div>
            Come August my body could take some abuse so I threw out my injury-risk-aversion and dug deep to execute as much volume
            as I could handle. <a href="/blogTrainForm.html" class="quiet-link">See my more about it here.</a><br><br>
            <img src="./images/blog-photos/arbizonMassif.jpg" alt="running uphill">
            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Race Summary</div>
            I raced seven times with a total of 440km with 31400m of climb. The most important metric was the general upward trend in the quality of my results. In retrospect I would substitute early-season short races for one or two at marathon/50k distance. The finale of Canfranc-Canfranc to the Grand Raid was perfect. In each race I learned something, so I have no regrets, but in the future I plan on asking myself why for each race, how does it fit in with the training scheme and lend itself to the year's primary objectives?<br><br>
               
            <div class="content-paragraph-subhead">Training Approach Summary</div>
       This year revealed a lot to me. Work to do but plenty of potential. If I had to point my finger at one thing which enabled me to achieve a world-class result at the Grand Raid it would be my unrelenting
        consistency. Life is hard on the training, training is hard on the body, there were so many days when I had to just
        force the session, clawing my way toward a distant dream of success.

            Thanks for reading, if you made it this far you must share interest in training and running. Its not easy crafting the perfect race calendar or training plan. <span class="underline">If you are looking for help don't hesitate to send me an email at bdhiman244@gmail.com and we can make it happen!</span> <br><br>
